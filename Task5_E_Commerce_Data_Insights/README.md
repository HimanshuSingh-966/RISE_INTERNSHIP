## Data Source

The application uses the [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This is a transnational dataset that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based non-store online retail.

The dataset is included in this repository as `e_commerce_data.csv`.

## How to Run

To run this dashboard on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/himanshusingh-966/RISE_INTERNSHIP.git](https://github.com/himanshusingh-966/RISE_INTERNSHIP.git)
    cd RISE_INTERNSHIP/Task5_E_Commerce_Data_Insights
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
